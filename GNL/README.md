# Get Next Line

The "Get Next Line" (GNL) is a project of Level 1 at the 42 programming school. The goal of the project is to write a function in C that can read a line ending in a newline character from a file descriptor. This project is part of the 42 curriculum and serves as excellent practice for handling input/output operations and gaining a deeper understanding of how low-level systems programming works.

### Objectives and Key Learnings

1. **File Handling**: The function must properly manage file descriptors to read from files, standard inputs, or any other types of streams supported by the operating system.
2. **Dynamic Memory**: Usage of dynamic memory allocation, as the function needs to be capable of reading lines of undefined length.
3. **Buffering**: Implementation of a buffer to store characters read from the file, which involves good handling of strings and arrays.
4. **Edge Cases**: Handling of special cases, such as empty lines or files without a newline at the end.

### Function Structure

The typical signature of the function looks like this:

```c
int get_next_line(int fd, char **line);
```

- **`fd`**: The file descriptor from which to read.
- **`line`**: A pointer to a character pointer, where the function will store the line read from the file.

### Implementation Challenges

- **Efficiency**: The function should be efficient both in terms of memory usage and performance, handling large files smoothly.
- **Robustness**: It must be robust against various file conditions and potential errors in file handling.
- **Portability**: Written in C, the function should be portable across different platforms that support C programming.

This project not only reinforces the student's understanding of file I/O but also deepens their skills in managing memory and improving the efficiency of their code. It's a practical stepping stone for more complex programming tasks that involve direct interaction with the operating system's resources.
