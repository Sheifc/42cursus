# Push_swap

"Push_swap" is a popular programming project that involves creating a sorting program. The objective is to sort data on a stack with a limited set of instructions, using the least number of moves possible. The data must be organised in a stack called "A," and optionally a second stack called "B" can be used to assist in the sorting process. The challenge is to sort the numbers in ascending order in stack "A" using a predetermined set of operations such as push, swap, rotate, and reverse rotate. The project is often used to teach algorithmic thinking and optimisation strategies in coding.

In the bonus part of the "push_swap" project, additional features and functionalities are typically implemented to enhance the basic sorting program. In this case:

Checker Program: An additional program called "checker" which reads the stack and the operations performed by the "push_swap" program. It then checks if the stack is sorted correctly after all operations are applied. This serves to validate the correctness of the sorting algorithm.

The project follows the Nome of code v4 of 42 Network.
