# ft_lstdelone function

 `ft_lstdelone` it's designed to delete a single node from a linked list and properly handle the cleanup of memory associated with that node. 

# Implementation

```c
void	ft_lstdelone(t_list *lst, void (*del)(void *))
{
	if (!lst || !del)
		return ;
	(*del)(lst->content);
	free(lst);
}
```

# Step by step:

1. `void ft_lstdelone(t_list *lst, void (*del)(void *))`: This is the function declaration. It takes two arguments:
   - `lst`: A pointer to a `t_list` structure, which represents a single node in a linked list.
   - `del`: A pointer to a function that takes a `void*` argument and returns `void`. This function is responsible for freeing the memory occupied by the content of the node.

2. `if (!lst || !del) return;`: This line begins with an `if` statement. It checks two conditions:
   - `!lst`: This condition checks if the pointer `lst` is NULL. If it's NULL, it means that there is no node to delete, so the function simply returns without performing any further actions.
   - `!del`: This condition checks if the pointer `del` is NULL. If it's NULL, it means that there is no function provided for deallocating the content of the node. Again, in this case, the function returns without taking any action. This check is essential to ensure that the function is used safely and doesn't result in crashes due to dereferencing a NULL function pointer.

3. `(*del)(lst->content);`: This line calls the function pointed to by `del` and passes the `content` member of the `lst` node as its argument. The purpose of this is to use the `del` function to properly deallocate the memory occupied by the content of the node. The `lst->content` is typically a pointer to the data stored in the node.

4. `free(lst);`: After the content is deleted, this line frees the memory occupied by the `lst` node itself. This effectively removes the node from the linked list.

In summary, the `ft_lstdelone` function is used to delete a single node from a linked list. It checks for the existence of both the node and the deletion function to avoid errors. Then, it uses the provided deletion function (`del`) to free the memory associated with the content of the node and then frees the memory of the node itself. This function helps ensure proper memory management when working with linked lists.

This implementation doesn't pass francinette tests: 

```c
void	ft_lstdelone(t_list *lst, void (*del)(void *))
{
	if (*lst) // * it is not accepted  
	//expression must have arithmetic or pointer type
	{
		del(lst -> content);
		free(lst);
	}
}
```
This function is used to delete a single node in a linked list. Let me break down what this code does step by step:

1. `void ft_lstdelone(t_list *lst, void (*del)(void *))`: This is the function declaration. It takes two arguments:
   - `lst`: A pointer to a `t_list` structure, which presumably represents a node in a linked list.
   - `del`: A pointer to a function that takes a `void*` argument and returns `void`. This function is responsible for freeing the memory occupied by the content of the node.

2. `if (lst)`: This conditional statement checks if the input `lst` is not NULL. If `lst` is NULL, it means there is nothing to delete, so the function does nothing.

3. `del(lst -> content)`: This line calls the `del` function provided as an argument to the `ft_lstdelone` function. It passes the `content` member of the `lst` node to this function. The purpose of this is to free the memory occupied by the content of the node. The assumption is that the `del` function knows how to properly free the memory allocated for the content. The `lst->content` is typically a pointer to the data stored in the node.

4. `free(lst)`: After the content is deleted, this line frees the memory occupied by the `lst` node itself. This effectively removes the node from the linked list.

In summary, the `ft_lstdelone` function takes a node as input, deletes the content of the node using the `del` function, and then frees the memory occupied by the node itself. This function allows you to remove a single node from a linked list while properly handling the memory cleanup for both the node's content and the node itself.

# Why this second implementation doesn't work

The technical difference between `(*del)(lst->content);` and `del(lst->content);` lies in how they are used and what they imply in C or C++ programming.

1. `(*del)(lst->content);`:
   - This syntax is typically used when `del` is a function pointer.
   - It dereferences the function pointer `del` and then calls the function pointed to by `del`, passing `lst->content` as an argument.
   - It's a way to indirectly call a function through a pointer. `del` points to a function, and `(*del)` invokes that function.

2. `del(lst->content);`:
   - This syntax is used when `del` is a function itself.
   - It directly calls the function `del`, passing `lst->content` as an argument.
   - `del` is expected to be a callable function, not a function pointer.

In summary, the difference is in how the function `del` is treated:

- If `del` is a function pointer, you use `(*del)(...)` to call the function it points to.
- If `del` is a regular function, you call it directly as `del(...)`.

The choice between these two forms depends on how `del` is declared and defined in your code.
