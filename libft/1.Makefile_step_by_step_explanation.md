# Makefile 

## What is a Makefile?
----------------------

A Makefile in the context of C programming is a special file used to control the build process of a software project, particularly when dealing with large and complex projects that involve multiple source (.c) and header (.h) files.

- Key aspects:

**Automation of Compilation**: Makefiles automate the process of compiling source code into executable programs. This is especially useful when the project consists of many files, reducing the need to manually invoke the compiler for each file.

**Dependency Management**: It specifies how various components of the project depend on each other. For example, if a source file is modified, the Makefile helps in recompiling only that file and other files that depend on it, rather than recompiling the entire project.

**Rules and Targets**: A Makefile consists of a set of rules. Each rule specifies a target (often an executable or object file) and the files (dependencies) needed to create it. It also includes the command(s) to execute (like compilation commands) for building the target from these dependencies.

**Variables**: Makefiles allow the use of variables to store compiler flags, the compiler itself, or paths to libraries, making it easy to modify these values in one place without having to edit multiple command lines.

**Phony Targets**: These are targets that do not represent actual files; they serve as a way to group commands under a convenient name, like clean for deleting all the object files and executables.

**Extensibility**: Makefiles can be designed to be quite sophisticated, handling complex build requirements and even generating files needed for the build process.

**Portability**: A well-written Makefile can be used across different systems, requiring minimal changes to compile the project on a different platform or with a different compiler.

Makefiles play a crucial role in C/C++ development environments, streamlining the build process, ensuring consistent builds, and saving time for developers.

## Step by step explanation: 
----------------------------

```make
NAME = libft.a
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -Werror -Wextra
SRCS = ft_isalpha.c ft_isdigit.c ft_isalnum.c ft_isascii.c ft_isprint.c ft_strlen.c \
       ft_memset.c ft_bzero.c ft_memcpy.c ft_memmove.c ft_strlcpy.c ft_strlcat.c \
       ft_toupper.c ft_tolower.c ft_strchr.c ft_strrchr.c ft_strncmp.c ft_memchr.c \
       ft_memcmp.c ft_strnstr.c ft_atoi.c ft_calloc.c ft_strdup.c ft_substr.c ft_strjoin.c
OBJS = $(SRCS:.c=.o)
```
<div align="justify">
- `NAME = libft.a`: Defines the output file name that will be generated upon compilation. In this case, it's `libft.a`, which is the name of the library.

- `CC = gcc`: Defines the compiler that will be used to compile the C source files. In this case, `gcc` is used.

- `CFLAGS = -Wall -Werror -Wextra`: Sets the compilation flags that will be passed to the compiler. `-Wall` enables all warnings, `-Werror` treats warnings as errors, and `-Wextra` enables additional warnings. This helps ensure cleaner code without warnings.

- `SRCS`: Lists the source files (`.c`) that are part of your library. Each file is separated by a space.

- `OBJS = $(SRCS:.c=.o)`: Creates a list of object files (`.o`) corresponding to the source files listed in `SRCS`. It replaces the `.c` extension with `.o` for each source file.

INCLUDE = libft.h

```make
all: $(NAME)
```

- `all`: This is a rule that is executed by default when you run `make` without specific arguments. Here, it specifies that the default target is to build `$(NAME)`, which is the library.

```make
$(NAME): $(OBJS)
    ar rcs $(NAME) $(OBJS)
```

- `$(NAME): $(OBJS)`: Indicates that the `$(NAME)` target depends on the object files `$(OBJS)`. If any of the source files have changed, it will build the object files before creating the static library (`libft.a`) using the `ar` command.

```make
%.o: %.c
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@
```

- `%.o: %.c`: Defines a generic rule to build object files (`%.o`) from source files (`%.c`). `$<` represents the source file, and `$@` represents the object file. It uses the compiler (`$(CC)`) with the compilation flags (`$(CFLAGS)`) to compile each source file into a corresponding object file. `-c` to compile without mains. 

Note: If you add @rm it doesn't create an echo on the terminal. 
```make
clean:
    rm -f $(OBJS)
```

- `clean`: Defines a rule named `clean` that is used to delete all the object files (`$(OBJS)`) generated during compilation. This cleans up the temporary files.

```make
fclean: clean
    rm -f $(NAME)
```

- `fclean`: Defines a rule named `fclean` that depends on the `clean` rule. The `fclean` rule is used to delete the output file (`$(NAME)`) in addition to the object files. This completely cleans the project.

```make
re: fclean all
```
## What does it mean SRCS?

In the context of the provided Makefile, `SRCS` does not refer to a folder where the `.c` files are located. Instead, `SRCS` is a variable that stores a list of the names of source files (`.c` files) that are part of the library. The file names listed in `SRCS` are the individual source files that will be compiled to build the `libft.a` library.

If the source files are located in a specific folder, you should specify the full or relative path to that folder when listing the file names in the `SRCS` variable. For example, if all your source files are in a folder named `src`, you could define `SRCS` like this:

```make
SRCS = src/ft_isalpha.c src/ft_isdigit.c src/ft_strlen.c ...
```

This would indicate that the source files are in the `src` folder and should be included in the compilation. Make sure to adjust the path according to the actual location of your source files.

## What is .PHONY?

In a Makefile, `.PHONY` is a special target used to declare certain targets as "phony" or "fake" targets. Phony targets are targets that do not represent actual files or dependencies in the filesystem. Instead, they are used to specify actions that should be executed when you explicitly request those targets, regardless of whether there are actual files with the same names.

For example, in the provided Makefile, you might see something like this:

```make
.PHONY: clean fclean re
```

In this case:

- `clean`, `fclean`, and `re` are declared as phony targets.
- `clean` is typically used to remove temporary files or object files.
- `fclean` is used to clean the project more thoroughly, often including removing the compiled output and temporary files.
- `re` is used to rebuild the project from scratch.

By declaring these targets as phony, you're telling Make that they are not actual files but rather actions or tasks that should be performed when requested. This ensures that Make will always execute the specified commands for these targets, regardless of whether there are actual files named `clean`, `fclean`, or `re` in the directory.

Declaring targets as phony is a common practice in Makefiles to avoid conflicts or issues that might arise if real files with the same names as the targets exist in the directory.

The order in which you declare `.PHONY` targets in a Makefile does not make a difference in how they function. Whether you declare `.PHONY` before or after the target name like this:

```make
.PHONY: clean
clean:
    rm -rf *.o
```

or like this:

```make
clean:
    rm -rf *.o
.PHONY: clean
```

Both declarations achieve the same result: they mark the `clean` target as a phony target, indicating that it doesn't represent an actual file and that the associated commands should always be executed when the `clean` target is invoked. The order of declaration does not affect the behavior of the phony target itself.

## What does it mean this on the code: $< -o $@: lev's get deeper:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In a Makefile recipe, `$<` and `$@` are special variables used to represent file names. Here's what they mean:

- `$<`: Represents the first prerequisite (dependency) of the rule. In other words, it stands for the source file that triggered the rule. In the context of compiling C code, it typically represents the `.c` source file.

- `$@`: Represents the target file, which is the file that you want to create or update. In the context of compiling C code, it usually represents the `.o` object file.

Let's break down the following line of code from your Makefile:

```make
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@
```

- `$(CC)`: This is the compiler (e.g., `gcc`) specified in the Makefile.

- `$(CFLAGS)`: These are the compiler flags (e.g., `-Wall -Werror -Wextra`) specified in the Makefile.

- `-c`: This flag is used to tell the compiler to generate an object file (`.o`) rather than an executable. It compiles the source file into an object file. 

So, the files .c and .h pass to the preprocessor, compiler, assembler and this one generates the files .o which go to the linker to generate the executable file .out. 

So the option -c is the one takes the files .c and .h and generates .o.

- `$<`: This variable represents the source file (`.c`) that triggered the rule. For example, if you are compiling `foo.c`, `$<` will be replaced with `foo.c`.

- `-o`: This flag is used to specify the output file.

- `$@`: This variable represents the target file (`.o`) that you want to create or update. For example, if you are compiling `foo.c` to create `foo.o`, `$@` will be replaced with `foo.o`.

So, when you run this line, it tells the compiler (`$(CC)`) to compile the source file (`$<`) into the target object file (`$@`) with the specified compiler flags (`$(CFLAGS)`). This is a common pattern in Makefiles for compiling source code into object files.

## Why we need to convert .c file to .o in the makefile instead of just gcc file1.c file2.c -o newfile:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating `.o` (object) files from `.c` (source) files is an intermediate step in the process of compiling C or C++ code. This step is important for several reasons:

1. **Compilation Efficiency:** Compiling a large codebase can be time-consuming. When you make changes to a single source file, you don't want to recompile the entire codebase. Object files allow for incremental compilation. You only need to recompile the source files that have changed, and then link them with the existing object files to create the final executable.

2. **Modularisation:** Object files allow you to compile individual source files independently. This promotes code modularity and makes it easier to work on different parts of a project simultaneously.

3. **Reusability:** Once you've compiled a source file into an object file, you can reuse that object file when building multiple programs or libraries. This saves compilation time and resources.

4. **Separation of Concerns:** Compilers perform source code translation into machine code in multiple steps. Object files contain the machine code generated from the source code along with other information needed for linking. By separating the compilation and linking phases, it's easier to manage complex projects.

Here's an overview of the typical compilation process:
------------------------------------------------------

1. **Compilation**: Each `.c` file is compiled separately into a corresponding `.o` file. This step involves translating high-level C code into low-level machine code and creating object files with relocatable code and data.

2. **Linking**: Once all the necessary object files are created, they are linked together to create the final executable or library. This step resolves references between different parts of the program, bringing in the necessary code from libraries and creating a standalone executable.

In summary, creating object files from source files is a fundamental part of the compilation process in C and C++ programming. It enables efficient and modular development, reduces compilation time, and allows for code reuse.
