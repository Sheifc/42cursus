# errno

The statement, "The function need not affect the value of errno on an error," is related to how errors are handled in programming, particularly in functions or routines that may encounter errors during their execution.

- **errno**: In programming, especially in C and C++ languages, `errno` is a global integer variable that is used to indicate and report errors that occur during the execution of certain functions. When a function encounters an error, it may set the value of `errno` to a specific error code, which can then be checked by the calling code to determine what kind of error occurred.

- **The function need not affect the value of errno on an error**: This statement is saying that not all functions, when they encounter an error, will necessarily modify or set the `errno` variable. In some cases, a function may choose not to update `errno`, even if an error occurs within it. This is a design choice made by the developers of the function.

For example, if you have a function that reads data from a file and encounters an error, it might set `errno` to indicate the type of error, such as "file not found" or "permission denied." However, another function that performs a different task, like calculating the square root of a number, might not have any use for `errno` and might choose not to modify it even if an error condition arises.

In summary, this statement is emphasising that not all functions follow the same convention when it comes to handling and reporting errors using the `errno` variable. It depends on the design and purpose of the function.
