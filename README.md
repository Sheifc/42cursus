Welcome to my 42 cursus repository! 

Here, it can be found the projects performed at 42 programming campus as part of the common core. Later on, there are specialisations.

Every project has the code written following the norma of the campus, which includes the rule of no comments in the code, for those who are interested in a deeper understanding of the project, specially if you are learning I have include a README file in every project folder which contains the notes I wrote to prepare the defence of the project. 

Every project must be defended to 3 different peer evaluators which will ask you all they need and test your code to check that you understand perfectly the project, the code can handle special cases and doesnÂ´t perform memory leaks. Finally, the final evaluation is done by a software tester. The average of the 4 total evaluations will be the final qualification of the project, even if your project is evaluated as perfect by the software tester, if any peer evaluator gave you lower qualification, this will reduce the final qualification as it is equally important how good are you defending your project. 

This is only one aspect of how we build soft skills at 42 campus, which are not built at university or any other schools. This is the advantage of 42 methodology as well as reinforcing a team spirit, you become a coder and evaluator. As we are almost 900 student at the campus, we develop not only a clean code skill, but also you evaluate that many students and many ways of performing the same project that you can improve your style and performance in a short period of time.

The profile of 42 students have in common curiosity, proactivity, active personality and willingness to learn always a new skill which is essential in the informatics field. 

The levels at 42 start at level zero which consist in one project and finish at level 6, every certain level has an examn which covers the content from previous levels, this must be passed with 100/100 in order to be able to continue progressing:
