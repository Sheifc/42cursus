Here it can be found the projects performed at 42 programming school as part of the common core. 

Every project has the code with is written following the norma of the school, which includes the rule of no comments in the code, for those who are interested in a deeper understanding of the project, a README will be included in every project folder with my notes written which were done to prepare the defence of the projects at the school. 

Every project must be defended to 3 different peer evaluators which will ask all they need to check that you understand perfectly the project, plus the final evaluation of a software. The avarage of the 4 total evaluations with be the final result, even if your project is evaluated as perfect by the software, if any peer evaluator gave you lower qualification, this will reduce the final result as it is equal important how good is the project and how good are you defend it. 

This is only one aspect of how we build soft skills at 42 school, which are not build at university or any other schools. This is the advantage of 42 methodology as well as reinforcement a team spirit, you become a coder and evaluator, as we are almost 900 student at the school we develop not only a clean code skill, but also you evaluate that many students and many ways of performing the same project than you can improve your style and performance very quick.

The profile of 42 students have in common curiosity, active person, proactive and willing to learn always a new skill which is essential in the informatics field.
